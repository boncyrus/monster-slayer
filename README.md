# Monster Slayer

## Overview
I made this project while I was enrolled in a Vue course in our company. As part of the final project, we were given the opportunity to showcase what we've learned by building the Monster Slayer game. I entrolled in the course to gain knowledge on Vue and at the same time compare it with the major UI frameworks / library such as React and Angular which I have experienced with in the past.
